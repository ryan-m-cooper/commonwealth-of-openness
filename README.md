# A Commonwealth of Openness

## Abstract
> On the first day of his administration in 2009, President Obama made opening public data a
national priority. Since then public agencies, states, counties, and municipalities nationwide have
realized the benefits of opening public data. Still, in many places an ethos of openness of public
geospatial data, including Kentucky, is the exception rather than the rule. Drawing on the case of recent
imports of public building footprint data into OpenStreetMap by civic hacking groups in Louisville and
Lexington I suggest that the fullest value of Kentuckyâ€™s public spatial data is realized by placing it in the
hands of the public.
